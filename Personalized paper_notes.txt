1- New technologies in TV industry make use of the Web 
to interact with TV content on set top boxes.
2- Electronic Program Guide (EPGs) help creating creating personal recommendation services based on 
users habits. NoTube go further because the actual solutions are bound to one plateform (e.g: set top box,
Web or rather TV-centric) . The presence of the users in social networks (MySpace, YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, etc..)
are not fully used in the actual solution in uer-TV interaction.
3- Notube projects aims to overcome these deficiencies through 3 different scenarios:
    + personalized semantic news
	+ narrowcasting advertisement
	+ community based content selection
	
 A- Personalized semantic news
 This scenario is focused n the creation, distribution and usage of personalized news services enabling (1) 
 acquire news items from generic broadcast streams, (2) understand the meaning of video news items, (3) understang
 the physical context in which the items are shown and (4) apply criteria for matching the user profile with teh available
 news items.
 
 In this use case, NoTube is service-oriented and exposes services in SOAP, REST APIs or both, and the services
 organized in four layers, with the final goal to produce a personalized experience to the end user.
 
 B- Expected Added Value
  The user get in his home environment segments of his own interest represented not only by audio-video, but
   also by audio-only or text-only or by other metadata and likns to related external resources on the Web (e.g: 
   using Linked Data paradigm)
